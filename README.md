# Hot Companies Job Board

A curated job board that ONLY shows jobs from hot, funded companies (Seed, Series A/B/C/D, Pre-IPO, Public Companies). We scrape jobs directly from company career pages - no 3rd party postings. AI matches developers to these high-quality opportunities.

## 🎯 What We're Building

**The Problem:** Job seekers waste time on unqualified jobs and companies they don't care about. Traditional job boards mix everything together.

**The Solution:**

- Only show jobs from hot, funded companies
- Scrape jobs directly (always fresh, no waiting)
- AI matching to show only jobs you're qualified for
- Company intelligence built-in (funding, hot score, reviews)
- Smart tracking (only track companies you care about)
