## My full stack journey

- focused more heavy on the backend and system design
- lightweight frontend using NextJS and Tailwind
- Microservice baackend
- Using technologies like gRPC
-

## Tech stack

- NextJS and Tailwind for frontend
- Golang for microservices backend
- Postgres for DB
- will try to use redis for caching
- will try to use kafka for messaging
- will use grpc for internal service communication
- will use http/rest for frontend vs backend communication
- will use cloud to hotes gcp or aws
- will use docker to containerize

- will learn datadog or others for logging

## Notes

- Not use AI to write code

## Pre

- I did a lot of research initially with the help of

## Day 1 - 10/22/2025

- I chatted with AI around what I should build this has been my biggest challenge so far even before day 1 as I have been wanting to build something useful but came to a conclusion that I want to start with a custom ecommerce website that's somewhat complex
- I set up my repo but I should've probably done some system architecture design and requirements gathering if I were in a professional setting but since I'm more focused on learnning new technologies, I say let's just jump in.

## Day 2 - 10/23/2025

- Set up gateway service
- Set up basic handler for Hello and GetProducts that will call Products service
- Set up clients where handlers will utilize clients to call Products service
- Use grpc call to products service

## Day 3 - 10/24/2025

- Set up products repo
- created basic template
- need to set up proto and spin up grpc server
- signed up buf registry to maintain proto files
